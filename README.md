# ChaCha
This is an implementation of the ChaCha stream cipher in C that aims to be completely compliant with https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8439. This is just a learning project so I don't recomend using this in production.

With time, I plan on improving this project and turning it into a useable ChaCha & Poly1305 encryption libary.

If you would like to make a contribution to this project, please open up an issue and send me some advice/reasources to help me learn what I am doing incorrectly or what I could be doing better. That would help a lot!!!
